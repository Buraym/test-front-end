# Joinads Frontend Test

## Intro
Welcome, developer! We’re excited to have you here and eager to see your creativity and skills in action. For this test, you’ll work with an API to retrieve and display a list of items on a single page.

- Your task involves:
  - A list page.
  - When a list item is selected, show additional details on a **separate page**
- We recommend using [this API](https://www.freepublicapis.com/harry-potter-api)
  - [This endpoint is the most reliable](https://hp-api.onrender.com/api/characters/staff)
- [Example](https://store.refine.dev/) of the test.
- You’ll have some flexibility in how you approach this, and we encourage you to make the project as clean and efficient as possible.

- The search should be used with the name of the item.
- List page.
  - The list needs to be ordered
- Show page.
  - Show the maximum amount of information

## Non-functional requirements

- Responsive design
- Repo Vercel deployment

## What we will consider
- Files and folders organization.
- Well uses of React hooks
- GitFlow
  - Commits naming convention
- Componentization

## Optional, but can add some points
- Use an external lib for fetch requests, [useQuery](https://tanstack.com/query), for example.
- Use Image lazy-loading, if necessary.
- Use [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com)

## Tips
- Usage of vite
- No need to waste time developing your own CSS components by yourself. Use MUI components instead.
