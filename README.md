# Joinads Frontend Test

## Intro
Welcome, developer! We’re excited to have you here and eager to see your creativity and skills in action. For this test, you’ll work with an API to retrieve and display a list of items on a single page. We want to keep things simple, yet elegant, to give you a chance to demonstrate your organizational skills, attention to detail, and ability to build well-structured components.

- Your task involves displaying a 
  - list in a table format
  - a list item is selected, showing additional details on a **separate page**. 
- Example of [template](https://example.refine.dev/categories/1?pageSize=6&current=1)
- You’ll have some flexibility in how you approach this, and we encourage you to make the project as clean and efficient as possible.

- Fork this repo and send your repo to this email: gabriely.santos@joinads.me

## Requirements
- It should be in typescript
- The list should be displayed using [MUI DataGrid table](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/).
- The search should be used with the name of the item.
- List page.
- Show page.

## Non-functional requirements
- Your design
- Responsive design
- Repo Vercel deployment

## What we will consider
- Files and folders organization.
- Well uses of React hooks
- GitFlow
  - Commits naming convention
- Componentization

## Optional, but can add some points
- Use an external lib for fetch requests, [useQuery](https://tanstack.com/query), for example.
- Use Image lazy-loading, if necessary.
- Use [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com)

## Tips
- Usage of vite
- No need to waste time developing your own CSS components by yourself. Use MUI components instead.
